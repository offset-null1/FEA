My goal is to become the top ai expert and influencer in the world.
I want to work with Andrew NG he cofounded and led google brain, Elon musk chief designer of spaceX . 
I love ai and space therefore I want to contribute in world's space technology. 
I also want to work for ISRO and nasa and do space research for celestial bodies and develop more efficient technologies which unites the power of physics and computers.
I also want to learn quantum computing and build top deep learning models on that.
I want to be the best at my work. 

My weaknesses are sometimes I underestimate myself and panic for no reason. And I worry unnecessarily thinking I'm not capable enough.
My strengths are I'm determined if I make my mind to achieve something, I'm really into it no matter what happens.
And I admit my mistakes and  always try to improve and evolve as a better personality physically and mentally.
I love researching and learning new things and I'm very ingenious, innovative and curious.
I try to approach the problem in all possible ways rather than settling on a naive solution.
